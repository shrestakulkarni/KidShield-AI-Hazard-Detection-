# KidShield-AI-Hazard-Detection-

KidShield AI is a real-time hazard detection system developed using Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv3. It identifies potentially dangerous objects such as knives and scissors from a live webcam feed and triggers an alert if a young child is detected nearby using an integrated age estimation model. This project aims to enhance home safety by combining object detection and AI-based age estimation for child protection.
